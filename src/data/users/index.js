I obtained a PhD from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) where I worked with Deva Ramanan (here's a link to my dissertation). Earlier I graduated with a masters from CMU as well, working with Martial Hebert, Abhinav Gupta, Kris Kitani and David Fouhey as a Siebel Scholar. Even before I was a CS undergrad at IIIT, Hyderabad, working with C. V. Jawahar. I have also been fortunate to work with some amazing people through internships, at DeepMind (with Andrew Zisserman, João Carreira and Carl Doersch), Adobe Research (with Josef Sivic and Bryan Russell) and Facebook AI (with Lorenzo Torresani, Georgia Gkioxari and Du Tran).",
