    description: 'Semantic segmentation, or image segmentation, is the task of clustering parts of an image together which belong to the same object class. It is a form of pixel-level prediction because each pixel in an image is classified according to a category. Some example benchmarks for this task are Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC and ADE20K. Models are usually evaluated with the Mean Intersection-Over-Union (Mean IoU) and Pixel Accuracy metrics.',
