    description: 'With 3D image segmentation, data acquired from 3D imaging modalities such as Computed Tomography (CT), Micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT or X-ray) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners is labelled to isolate regions of interest. These regions represent any subject or sub-region within the scan that will later be scrutinized. This could facilitate analysis of part of the human body, or a specific feature within an industrial component or assembly.',
