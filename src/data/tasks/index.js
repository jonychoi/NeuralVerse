The main idea of Self-Supervised Learning is to generate the labels from unlabeled data, according to the structure or characteristics of the data itself, and then train on this unsupervised data in a supervised manner. Self-Supervised Learning is wildly used in representation learning to make a model learn the latent features of the data.
